# A Squirrel World
Data Viz Project of NYC's 2018 Squirrel Census

As a part of my final project for DSCI 304 (Data Visualization) at Rice, I chose to look at New York City's [Official 2018 Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw).

You can view my findings about the squirrels of Central Park [here](https://gazifuad.github.io/ASquirrelWorld/).
